# MCP Briefing Templates

Canonical, Git-managed briefing templates for MCP session initialization now live in this directory.

## Templates

- `native-desktop-mcp-briefing/`: minimal desktop UI MCP-only briefing pack.
- `native-terminal-mcp-briefing/`: minimal terminal/host-v2 MCP-only briefing pack.
- `native-desktop-mcp-briefing-extras/`: related bootstrap contracts, validation matrix, and host-v2 helper scripts.

## Scope

These folders are intended to be self-contained briefing packages. Paths used in templates should resolve within each package.

## Source Control Rule

Update briefing templates in this repo path moving forward. External copies under `projects/enceladus/agent-reference/` are no longer canonical.
