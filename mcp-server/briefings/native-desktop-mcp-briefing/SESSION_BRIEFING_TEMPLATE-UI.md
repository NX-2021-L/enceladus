```text
enceladus

This is an MCP-only session. All interactions with Enceladus system resources
go through the active Enceladus MCP server alias (for example: enceladus or enceladus-local). Do not use direct CLI tools, AWS SDK,
or cloud API access.

Governance resource: governance://agents.md

Resolve the active Enceladus MCP server alias, then read governance://agents.md
and follow its session initialization instructions.
